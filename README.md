# Linux-Device-Driver

This repo is focused on designing a simple linux device driver for communicating with an AVR128DB48 card. The main objective is to establish a decent testing enviroment and implement the driver on a RPI3 card while connecting it to the AVR card. The testing will be performed using a python file.

## Struccture of the project
This project is divided into 3 folders which are:
* Testing
* RPi3
* AVR

As the names suggest they contain files related to those parts of the project.

## Notes
Due to the small scope of the project a .gitignore file was not included.

## TODO:
* Implement a simple char driver
* Implement a simple block driver
* Implement a simple network driver
